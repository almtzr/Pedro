# Pedro Robot

Pedro is a sophisticated mini robotic arm designed to be entirely 3D printed and assembled without any tools. Equipped with four mini servo motors and powered by a custom-made Arduino-compatible board, Pedro offers versatile wireless communication options with its integrated **nRF24L01 module for remote control**, **HC-05 Bluetooth module for smartphone connectivity**, and **ESP8266 WiFi module for IoT integration**. It also features an **OLED 128x64 display**, allowing real-time feedback and data visualization.

<br>

Since 2025, Pedro Robot is certified as open-source hardware by the Open Source Hardware Association under UID: [FR000025](https://certification.oshwa.org/fr000025.html).

To ensure smooth and accurate operations, Pedro is equipped with two ball bearings, strategically placed for enhanced precision in its movements. This versatile and educational robot is perfect for hobbyists, students, and makers looking to explore robotics, electronics, and programming, all while enjoying a hands-on and engaging experience.

## 1. Features

Pedro is a compact, DIY robot that you can build and program yourself. All parts of Pedro are designed to be 3D printed, and the robot can be assembled without any additional tools.

</br>

- **4 Mini Servo Motors**: For precise movements.
- **Arduino-Compatible Board**: Designed specifically for this project, offering easy integration with the robot's components.
- **Two Rechargeable 18650 Batteries**: Powering the robot, rechargeable via USB.
- **Fully 3D Printable**: All structural components can be printed on a standard 3D printer.
- **Tool-Free Assembly**: Designed to snap together easily without the need for tools.
- **Micro USB Cable**: For Charging and Programming.

## 2. Boards

The Pedro Board is here to revolutionize how you learn and create in electronics, programming, and robotics. Designed with simplicity and versatility in mind, this open-source board comes in two versions: the **Pedro Rev 3** with 4 powerful integrated modules (**NRF24L01**, **ESP8266-01**, **HC-05**, and **OLED 128x64**) and the **Pedro Rev 2** with 2 integrated modules (**NRF24L01** and **OLED 128x64**). Both versions offer a compact and efficient design to help you bring your robotic projects to life!

Additionally, the **Gerber files for the Pedro Rev 2** are available for those who want to create their own custom Pedro robot board.
