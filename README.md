- **4 Mini Servo Motors**: For precise movements.
- **Arduino-Compatible Board**: Designed specifically for this project, offering easy integration with the robot's components.
- **Two Rechargeable 18650 Batteries**: Powering the robot, rechargeable via USB.
- **Fully 3D Printable**: All structural components can be printed on a standard 3D printer.
- **Tool-Free Assembly**: Designed to snap together easily without the need for tools.
- **Micro USB Cable**: For Charging and Programming.

## 2. Boards

The Pedro Board is here to revolutionize how you learn and create in electronics, programming, and robotics. Designed with simplicity and versatility in mind, this open-source board comes in two versions: the **Pedro Rev 3** with 4 powerful integrated modules (**NRF24L01**, **ESP8266-01**, **HC-05**, and **OLED 128x64**) and the **Pedro Rev 2** with 2 integrated modules (**NRF24L01** and **OLED 128x64**). Both versions offer a compact and efficient design to help you bring your robotic projects to life!

Additionally, the **Gerber files for the Pedro Rev 2** are available for those who want to create their own custom Pedro robot board.
